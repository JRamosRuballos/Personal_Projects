# Face Recognition Tool

This is a Python face recognition tool built with OpenCV and DeepFace. 

The purpose of this project was to try out facial recognition libraries in Python. This project was done by following NeuralNine's "Live Face Recognition in Python" tutorial on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQvkoaevVMk). A minor modification was made to the project to make it be able to run on macOS. I also edited the code so that it would allow multiple images to be used as references.
